# [impossible basket ball] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: unused import]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [An Mary Joseph] - [Jyothi Engineering College]
- Member 2: [Abhiram S] - [Jyothi Engineering College]

### Project Description
[People enjoy winning games, which makes them happy. We think that‚Äôs a problem ‚Äî people are far too happy these days

]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[A browser-based basketball game designed to ensure you never score. With unpredictable wind, a misleading aim curve, and physics that hate you, this is the most frustrating way to waste time online.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created a basketball game where every shot misses, no matter what you do. Add in random wind conditions, deceptive aim indicators, and hoop movements, and you‚Äôll experience pure sporting misery.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript]
- [ None ]
- [None]
- [VS Code, GitHub, Browser DevTools]

For Hardware:
None ‚Äî except your computer, mouse, and emotional resilience.

## Team Contributions
- [Abhirm S]: [Designed the game mechanics, implemented the core JavaScript physics engine, created the wind toggle and right aim curve system, and integrated the guaranteed-miss logic so the game remains impossible.]
- [An Mary joseph]: [Handled UI/UX design, styled the HTML/CSS for menus and scoreboards, added animations for ball movement, and tweaked visuals so players feel confident‚Ä¶ right before missing.]
